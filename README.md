## Thoughts

Decided to use Angular as I know it fairly well. At first I was looking to use the Expedia api (because it has easily accessible image links with each car option) but after waiting too long for them to get back to me regarding the mysterious location codes, I continued onward with Hotwire. Though the media/images are less user friendly, so I decided to download the US based images and then sub in a 'special car' image for overseas/manual vechile ones.

I also wanted to keep this as light as possible (given the single html requirement), so I didn't want to use additional libraries such as jquery or bootstrap and opted for the native datepicker which turned out to be not so bad styling, though it hasn't played very nice sat next to a select tag.

I also made some media queries but overall, the functionality and look is optimized for Chrome, though it should work okay with the others too.

Thanks!
